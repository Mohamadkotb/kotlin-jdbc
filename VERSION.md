## 0.2.2

* Fix: migration command to not apply versions higher than requested
* Add: IntelliJ Database script extension to create Models from database tables

  initial database creation without migrations.

* Add: add `updateGetLongId` and `updateGetLongIds` to return `Long` and `List<Long>` respectively

## 0.1.6

* Fix: iteration over empty result set caused exception, due to insufficient conditions present
  in result set to know there is no next row until next() is invoked.
* Add: rudimentary SQL based migrations with migrate/rollback with up/down sql scripts, table,
  procedure, function, view and trigger script running. Migrations are for data and tables. The
  rest of the scripts are applied for a given version. Needs docs and tests.
